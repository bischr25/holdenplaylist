    <h1>Holden’s Playlist</h1>
    <p>Songs that I think are representative of Holden in <br><em>The Catcher in the Rye</em></p>
  </header>

  <main>
    <div class="song">
      <h2>1. “Creep” — Radiohead</h2>
      <audio controls>
        <source src="audio/radiohead.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        Your browser does not support the audio element.
      </audio>
      <p>The song’s isolation is the same as Holden’s because they both talk about that they doesn’t fit in anywhere. Like the singer, Holden sees himself as someone with flaws and different from everyone else, even when he hides it behind sarcasm."But I'm a creem, I'm a weirdo, what the hell I'm doing here, I don't belong here"</p>
    </div>

    <div class="song">
      <h2>2. “Piano Man” — Billy Joel</h2>
      <audio controls>
        <source src="audio/piano-man.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
      </audio>
      <p>Holden often watches others from the side, noticing their stories and sadness. The song “Piano Man” feels like a musical version of that. It's sympathetic, lonely, and full of small, quiet moments.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="song">
      <h2>3. “Mad World” — Gary Jules</h2>
      <audio controls>
        <source src="audio/mad-world.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
      </audio>
      <p>This song shows Holden’s sadness and confusion about adulthood. The lyrics are the same as his constant feeling that the world around him doesn’t make sense.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="song">
      <h2>4. “New York, I Love You But You’re Bringing Me Down” — LCD Soundsystem</h2>
      <audio controls>
        <source src="audio/new-york.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
      </audio>
      <p>Holden loves and hates New York at the same time. This song shows that same love-hate relationship. It’s both critical and nostalgic about the city.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="song">
      <h2>5. “Asleep” — The Smiths</h2>
      <audio controls>
        <source src="audio/asleep.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
      </audio>
      <p>“Asleep” sounds like Holden’s thought of escape. Its sadness show his wish to run away and find peace from the “phoniness” of the world.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="song">
      <h2>6. “Hurt” — Johnny Cash</h2>
      <audio controls>
        <source src="audio/hurt.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
      </audio>
      <p>This song shows Holden’s pain over losing Allie. The emotions and honesty in Cash’s voice are the same as Holden’s grief and his struggle to cope with loss.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="song">
      <h2>7. “Teach Your Children” — Crosby, Stills & Nash</h2>
      <audio controls>
        <source src="audio/teach-your-children.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
      </audio>
      <p>Holden’s dream of being “the catcher in the rye” comes from wanting to protect kids’ innocence. This song amplifies that message. The need for care, understanding, and love between generations all have a direct link to Holden's thought process.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="song">
      <h2>8. “Circle Game” — Joni Mitchell</h2>
      <audio controls>
        <source src="audio/circle-game.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
      </audio>
      <p>The song accepts that time moves on and people grow up, which is something Holden fights against. It shows two of the things Holden fears most: change and the loss of innocence.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="song">
      <h2>9. “Landslide” — Fleetwood Mac</h2>
      <audio controls>
        <source src="audio/landslide.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
      </audio>
      <p>To end my playlist, the final song I chose is "Landslide".The song reveals sort of a fear of growing older and losing control, just like Holden’s feelings throughout the book. It’s kind, nostalgic, and has a bunch of self-doubt.</p>
